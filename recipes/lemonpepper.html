<h1>Crispy Pork Belly</h1>
<img src="recipes/pork-belly.jpg" alt="Roasted Pork Belly height="310 width="310"/>
<p>Who doesn’t love a pork roast? Meat that is perfectly cooked - tender, flavorful and juicy - combined with that golden-brown, crispy crackling which is always fought over in my house!
    The glaze used for this recipe though, is what makes me keep coming back to it.
    The flavours blend so perfectly - the sweetness of the honey and maple syrup is cut through by the acidic vinegar and tangy, sharp dijon mustard. Serve this at a family lunch or dinner and watch it disappear before your eyes!</p>
<ul>
    <li>1.5 kg pork belly roast</li>
    <li>2 tsp table salt</li>
    <li>80ml (1/3 cup) honey</li>
    <li>2 tbsp maple syrup</li>
    <li>3 tsp white wine vinegar</li>
    <li>2 tsp Dijon mustard</li>
</ul>

<h1>BBQ Ribs</h1>

<p>Homemade rib marinade is used in this barbecue ribs recipe that's easier than it looks. 
    I usually cook the ribs the day before and grill them for a quick dinner the next night. 
    The sauce is much better after it is cooked; it is not a dipping sauce.</p>
<ul>
    <li>4 pounds pork spareribs</li>
    <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
    <li>½ cup chile sauce</li>
    <li>¼ cup ketchup</li>
    <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
    <li>¼ cup Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>¼ cup rum</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dry mustard</li>
    <li>1 dash ground black pepper/li>
    <li>cooking spray/li>
</ul>
